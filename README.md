# real_estate_appraisal
In this repo I will try to combine web scraping with ML and shiny app development
Idea is to create an app which will allow user to input data about their real estate and compare it with similar real estates based on provided info

In the next steps I will work on scraping also descriptions on web, analyze the text and provide proposals for user based on most used topics
